# üõí Shopping Trends & Customer Behavior SQL Analysis

## üìä Project Overview

A single SQL query uncovered subtle patterns in customer shopping habits ‚Äî  
which revealed how weekly subscribers consistently drive predictable revenue.  
This insight inspired an interactive Excel dashboard that brought these trends to life for non-technical stakeholders,  
turning raw data into actionable business intelligence shaping marketing, sales, and retention strategies.  

From detailed customer demographics to nuanced payment preferences, this project layers SQL, Excel, and PowerPoint to tell a compelling story:  
small changes in targeting loyal customers ripple into stronger campaigns, better logistics, and increased lifetime value.

## üìÇ Deliverables

- **PowerPoint Presentation:** Visual storytelling to highlight key business insights  
- **Interactive Excel Dashboard:** Filterable, intuitive exploration for stakeholders  
- **README & Project Files:** Hosted on GitHub for easy collaboration and transparency  

## üìë Dataset Description

The dataset spans multiple dimensions of customer and transactional data:  
- Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location)  
- Purchase details (Item, Category, Amount)  
- Subscription & shipping preferences  
- Discounts, promo codes, and payment methods  
- Review ratings and purchase frequency  

Each data point contributes to a broader understanding of shopper behavior and revenue dynamics.

## üîç Business Questions & Insights

Medium raters show the **highest order value ($61.47) and frequency** ‚Äî  
indicating satisfaction improvements could increase overall transaction value.

## üõ† Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL (MySQL):** Complex queries, aggregation, segmentation  
- **Excel:** Interactive dashboards with PivotTables, slicers, and custom charts  
- **PowerPoint:** Visual storytelling and stakeholder presentations
