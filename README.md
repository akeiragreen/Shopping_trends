ðŸ›’ Shopping Trends & Customer Behavior SQL Analysis

ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project leverages SQL, Excel, and PowerPoint to perform a multi-layered analysis of customer shopping behaviors, revenue trends, and operational insights. The goal is to extract actionable business intelligence to guide marketing, sales, logistics, and customer retention strategies. This version expands upon the original SQL analysis with visual storytelling and interactive dashboards for stakeholders.

## Deliverables

- PowerPoint presentation of key visual insights
- Interactive Excel Dashboard with filters for non-technical exploration
- README documentation and project files hosted on GitHub

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer and transactional data across multiple dimensions:

- Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location)
- Purchase behavior (Item, Category, Purchase Amount)
- Subscription status and shipping preferences
- Discounts, promo codes, and payment methods
- Review ratings and purchase frequency

## Business Questions & Key Insights

### 1. Customer Behavior Analysis

**Question:** Who are our top 10 most valuable customers?

- All top 10 customers are male, subscribed, and shop weekly.
- Highly loyal, predictable revenue drivers.
- Retention strategies targeting weekly subscribers can yield strong returns.

### 2. Review Ratings vs Purchase Frequency

**Question:** What is the relationship between review ratings and purchase frequency?

- Infrequent shoppers tend to leave lower ratings.
- Bi-weekly shoppers spend more per transaction, even when reviews are mixed.
- Improving satisfaction for infrequent shoppers could increase loyalty.

### 3. Revenue & Seasonal Performance

**Question:** Which seasons generate the most revenue and purchases?

- Fall leads in revenue (~$756K); Spring has the highest transaction count (1,230 purchases).
- Focus Fall campaigns on high-value sales; optimize Spring for volume-based promotions.

### 4. Discounts & Promo Codes Impact

**Question:** Do discounts and promo codes increase purchase amount or frequency?

- Promo code users generate lower total purchases and revenue.
- Discounts without promo codes perform better financially.
- Promo code strategies should target high-value, long-term customers.

### 5. Shipping Type Preferences

**Question:** Which shipping types are preferred by high-value customers?

- Free shipping dominates among weekly subscribers.
- Express shipping appeals to a smaller, time-sensitive segment.
- Offering flexible shipping supports satisfaction and loyalty.

### 6. Payment Method Preferences

**Question:** What payment methods are most common among frequent shoppers?

- Credit Card is the top method (44 users), followed by PayPal (39 users).
- Supporting diverse digital payments enhances checkout experience.

### 7. Spending Behavior by Review Rating

**Question:** Do higher ratings correlate with more spending over time?

- High raters have fewer orders but higher average order values (~$60.62).
- Medium raters show the highest order value ($61.47) and purchase frequency.
- Boosting satisfaction may increase overall transaction value.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- SQL (MySQL): Advanced querying, aggregations, and segmentation
- Excel: Interactive dashboards (PivotTables, slicers, custom charts)
- PowerPoint: Visual storytelling of SQL analysis for stakeholder presentation
- GitHub: Version control, documentation, and portfolio hosting

## Business Implications

- Loyalty programs for weekly subscribers can maximize revenue.
- Optimize promo codes for long-term customer growth, not short-term spikes.
- Flexible shipping boosts customer retention.
- Satisfaction improvements can drive higher spending per transaction.
- Diverse payment methods reduce purchase friction.

## Next Steps (Future Development)

- Expand analysis to include regional or product-level segmentation.
- Migrate visualizations to Power BI or Tableau for broader BI adoption.
- Implement real-time SQL data refresh in Excel.
- Build predictive models for top customer forecasting and churn prevention.
