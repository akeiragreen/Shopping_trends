## Business Questions & Key Insights

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Behavior Analysis
**Question:** Who are our top 10 most valuable customers?
**Insight:**
- All top 10 customers are male, subscribed, and shop weekly.
- These high-value customers are highly loyal and predictable revenue drivers.
- Retention strategies for weekly subscribers can yield strong financial returns.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Review Ratings vs Purchase Frequency
**Question:** What is the relationship between review ratings and purchase frequency?
**Insight:**
- Infrequent shoppers often leave lower ratings, suggesting unmet expectations.
- Frequent shoppers (bi-weekly) spend more per transaction even when reviews are mixed.
- Improving the experience for infrequent shoppers may help convert them to high-frequency buyers.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue & Seasonal Performance
**Question:** Which seasons generate the most revenue and purchases?
**Insight:**
- Fall leads in revenue (~$756K), while Spring sees the highest transaction count (1,230 purchases).
- Fall should be the primary focus for revenue-boosting campaigns, with Spring optimized for volume-based promotions.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Discounts & Promo Codes Impact
**Question:** Do discounts and promo codes increase total purchase amount or frequency?
**Insight:**
- Promo code users generate the lowest total purchases and revenue.
- Discounts without promo codes perform better financially.
- The promo code strategy may need optimization to target higher-value, repeat customers rather than bargain hunters.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Shipping Type Preferences
**Question:** Which shipping type is preferred by high-value customers?
**Insight:**
- Free shipping is overwhelmingly preferred (52 top-tier customers).
- Express shipping appeals to a smaller, time-sensitive segment (39 customers).

- Providing diverse digital payment options helps maximize customer convenience.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Spending Behavior by Review Rating
**Question:** Do higher ratings correlate with more spending over time?
**Insight:**
- High raters have fewer orders but higher average order values (~$60.62).
- Medium raters have the highest average order value ($61.47) and purchase frequency.
- Low raters transact more but spend less per order.
